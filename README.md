# 🚀 CollaborativeCodePlayground

A modern **real-time collaborative-style code playground** built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project provides a clean 3-pane editor for writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with **instant live preview** and a built-in browser console. It is designed as a lightweight portfolio project demonstrating front-end engineering fundamentals without frameworks.

## 🧠 How It Works

- User input is captured from three editors
- Code is injected into an iframe using `srcdoc`
- JavaScript execution is wrapped in try/catch
- Console methods are overridden to capture logs
- Output is rendered in a custom console panel
